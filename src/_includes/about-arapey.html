        Arapey <span class="arapey-pronounced">(Ah-ra-pay)</span> is a contemporary modern
        typeface with some Bodoni characteristics, but the structures, smooth lines, and
        finishes leave a feeling of calm and distinction.
        The first sketches were made during a vacation in Arapey, a small town in northern
        Uruguay, a place of inspiration, where time seems to stop, giving us a space to
        make us reflect on the chosen design decisions and if they will reflect the same
        feelings that gives us the landscape where it was created.
